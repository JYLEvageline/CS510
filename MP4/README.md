Please update this file to contain sufficient information about how to run
your code, as well as clearly specify any additional required libraries or
software packages that must be installed.

Please also update the file `.gitlab-ci.yml` to both install your required
libraries/compilers as well as run your code (that file has useful comments
to help you). You are not _required_ to use CI to generate your results,
but you _must_ ensure that your code _can_ be run on the CI platform for
grading purposes.
